 ## Data Structures in Java

This repository contains Java implementations of various data structures and algorithms. It has some of my coding practice and learning journey in the field of data structures.

## Introduction
In this repository, you'll find Java code for various data structures, such as:
- **LinkedList**: Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Stack and Queue**: Implementations using arrays and linked lists.
- **Trees**: Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.
- **Graphs**: Common graph algorithms.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.

## Acknowledgement
I would like to thank my professor Gary Newell and my friends who helped to understand the algorithms and sructures of data.
